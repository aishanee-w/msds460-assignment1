The constraints for this linear programming problem, should consider seven components of nutrition and their daily values, as shown in the following table:

Component

Max/Min

Daily Amount and measure

Sodium

Maximum

5,000 milligrams (mg)

Energy

Minimum

2,000 Calories (kilocalories, kcal)

Protein

Minimum

50 grams (g)

Vitamin D

Minimum

20 micrograms (mcg)

Calcium

Minimum

1,300 milligrams (mg)

Iron

Minimum

18 milligrams (mg)

Potassium

Minimum

4,700 milligrams (mg)

Set this up as a standard linear programming problem with decision variables taking any non-negative values. In other words, partial servings are permitted.  The objective is to minimize cost and fulfill all nutritional requirements as outlined above.

Nutrition labels on packaged foods should contain information about these eight components of nutrition along with other components. Each of the components represents a constraint in the linear programming problem you are developing.

To adapt the problem to your personal diet, collect nutrition facts from five packaged food items in your household. Use packaged foods that are part of your normal diet and for which you have prices. Also, ensure that the across the set of food items there are positive values for each of the eight components of nutrition. Adjust the price for each food item so that it represents one serving size, as defined on the nutrition facts label. Each food item represents a decision variable in the linear programming problem.

The goal or objective of this problem is to find the minimum-cost diet (servings of food items) that satisfies the eight nutritional requirements. Use Python PuLP.

To solve this diet optimization problem using Python's PuLP, we will define a linear programming (LP) problem where the goal is to minimize the cost while ensuring that the daily nutritional requirements are satisfied.

Here’s the plan:
